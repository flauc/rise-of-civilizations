# Rise of Civilizations — Master Plan

A turn-based 4X strategy game (a "Civilization" clone) spanning the **Ancient Era → Age of Exploration** (c. 4000 BCE – c. 1550 CE). Browser-first, playable on desktop and mobile, rendered on HTML5 Canvas in TypeScript, with a Bun + PostgreSQL authoritative server for multiplayer. Simple graphics, deep gameplay.

### Design docs

## 1. Design Pillars

1. **Deep systems, simple surface.** Vector/procedural graphics keep the download tiny; the depth lives in the rules, not the pixels.
2. **History from clay to caravel.** The whole arc is the *pre-modern* world. No tanks, no gunpowder dominance — the late game peaks at early firearms, ocean-going ships, and gunpowder siege.
3. **Characters, not chess pieces.** Units have classes, promotions, named veterans, and "Great People" who are genuine characters with abilities — not just "warrior / archer."
4. **Many peoples.** 60+ playable civilizations from every inhabited continent, each with a unique unit, unique infrastructure, and a civ ability.
5. **Play anywhere, anytime.** Real-time *or* asynchronous ("play-by-cloud") multiplayer so a mobile player can take a turn over breakfast.
6. **Server-authoritative & cheat-resistant.** The client renders and sends orders; the server owns the truth.

## 2. Scope: Eras & Timeline

The game is divided into **five eras**. Each era gates technologies, units, buildings, and government types.

| Era | Rough dates | Flavor highlights |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| **Stone / Dawn** | 4000–3000 BCE | Tribes, settling, slings & clubs, first cities |
| **Bronze** | 3000–1200 BCE | Chariots, bronze arms, writing, ziggurats, early empires |
| **Iron / Classical** | 1200 BCE–500 CE | Legions, phalanxes, roads, philosophy, great empires |
| **Medieval / Faith** | 500–1300 CE | Knights, castles, cathedrals, universities, organized religion |
| **Exploration** | 1300–1550 CE | Caravels & galleons, gunpowder, banking, printing, global trade |

A "score / time limit" game ends at a configurable turn cap inside the Exploration era; victory can be claimed earlier.

## 3. Core Game Design

### 3.1 Map & Terrain
- **Hex grid** (preferred over square: cleaner movement, ranged, and adjacency math). Pointy-top hexes, axial coordinates `(q, r)`.
- **Two map sources, both from the start:**
  1. **Procedural** — generated server-side from a seed (reproducible, validatable, tiny to transmit). Tunable continents/Pangaea/archipelago, sea level, climate bands.
  2. **Real-world geodata maps** — *the World, a continent, or a region built from actual Earth geography* (see §3.1.1). Ships curated presets (Earth, Mediterranean, the Americas, East Asia, Europe) **and** lets us rasterize any region on demand.
- **Terrain types:** Ocean, Coast, Lake, River (edge feature), Plains, Grassland, Desert, Tundra, Snow, Forest, Jungle, Marsh, Hills, Mountains (impassable / adjacency bonus), Floodplains, Oasis.
- **Resources:**
  - *Bonus* (food/production): Wheat, Rice, Maize, Cattle, Sheep, Deer, Fish, Crabs, Bananas, Stone.
  - *Luxury* (happiness/amenities): Wine, Incense, Silk, Spices, Dyes, Furs, Ivory, Pearls, Salt, Tea, Cocoa, Citrus, Tobacco, Silver, Gold (lux).
  - *Strategic* (unlock units): Copper, Tin (→ Bronze), Horses, Iron, Saltpeter (Exploration gunpowder), War Elephants/ivory range.
- **Tile yields:** Food, Production, Gold, plus tile-worked Science/Culture/Faith via buildings & improvements.
- **Improvements (built by Workers):** Farm, Pasture, Plantation, Mine, Quarry, Lumber Mill, Camp, Fishing Boats, Road, Fort, Trading Post, Terrace Farm (civ), Polder (civ), etc.

### 3.1.1 Real-world maps from geodata (d3 / Natural Earth)
We can build playable Earth/continent/region maps from **open vector geodata** rather than hand-painting them, then bake the result into our hex format.

- **Data sources (all small & open):**
  - **Natural Earth** via the `world-atlas` / `topojson` packages — land, coastline, and country polygons. The 110m land file is only ~100 KB; 50m for regional zoom. Easily within the download budget.
  - Optional low-res **biome/climate** classification (Köppen) or an elevation tile to seed terrain; if we'd rather avoid the extra payload, we approximate biomes from **latitude + coastal distance** heuristics.
- **Pipeline (offline build step, in `tools/`):**
  1. Pick a region + **d3-geo projection** (equirectangular for the whole world; a regional projection — e.g. conic — for continents) and a hex resolution.
  2. For each hex, take its center lon/lat and test **`d3.geoContains(landPolygons, [lon, lat])`** → land vs ocean. Coast = land hex adjacent to ocean.
  3. Assign terrain by **latitude band + elevation/biome sample + coastal distance** (e.g. equatorial+wet → Jungle, mid-latitude → Grassland/Forest, subtropical-dry → Desert, high-latitude → Tundra/Snow, high elevation → Hills/Mountains). Rivers traced from coastline/elevation or a curated river layer.
  4. Place **resources & historical start positions** with a curated overlay (so Egypt starts on the Nile, etc.) layered on the procedural resource scatter.
  5. **Bake to our compact hex map format** (the same format procedural maps use) → the runtime never ships d3 or GeoJSON; it just loads a small baked map. d3 lives only in the build tool.
- **Why this is a clean fit:**
  - Keeps the runtime tiny — geodata processing is build-time, output is our normal map blob.
  - Same downstream code path as procedural maps (renderer/sim don't care how a map was made).
  - Lets us ship **curated historical presets** (Earth, Mediterranean, Americas, Europe, East Asia) and a tool to generate new regions later.
- **Curated layer on top:** named-region presets can hand-tune start bias, resources, and city-state spots for a more "historical" scenario feel, satisfying the *historically grounded* tone.
- **Concrete sources & licenses** (Natural Earth, world-atlas TopoJSON, DEM, biome data): see `docs/ASSETS-AND-DATA-SOURCES.md`.
- ✅ **Proven:** a working spike in `tools/geodata-poc/` already bakes the real Natural Earth land file into a recognizable Earth hex map (land/ocean + placeholder terrain). See its README for what's real vs. still placeholder (terrain biome, equal-area projection, output compaction).

### 3.2 Turn Model — *real-time simultaneous (primary), with async support*
- **Launch/primary mode: real-time simultaneous ("WeGo").** All players are online together; everyone plans and issues orders during the turn under a **shared turn timer**. When all players hit "end turn" (or the timer expires) the server resolves every player's orders in a deterministic order and advances. This is the mode we build and tune first (M3).
- This scales far better than strict sequential turns for 4–12 players and keeps sessions moving on mobile.
- **Combat between two human players** in the same turn is resolved by submission order with a documented, deterministic tie-break, plus an optional brief **"combat lock" sub-phase** so simultaneous attacks resolve fairly (the trickiest fairness problem — gets its own design doc before M3).
- **Asynchronous / play-by-cloud:** the *same* simultaneous engine, but a game can be flagged async with a long per-turn deadline (e.g. 24h). The server notifies (push/web-push/email) when the turn is ready. State lives in Postgres; nobody needs to be online at once. Shipped right after the real-time path since it reuses the same resolution code.
- **Hotseat / single-player vs AI** uses the same engine with a local server loop.

### 3.3 Economy / Yields
Per-city and per-empire ledgers:
- **Food** → city growth (population) & settlers.
- **Production** → units, buildings, wonders.
- **Gold** → empire-wide treasury; buy units/buildings, upgrade, maintenance, bribes.
- **Science** → tech tree progress (empire pool).
- **Culture** → civic tree progress + border expansion + tourism (culture victory).
- **Faith** → religion: prophets, missionaries, holy buildings, faith-purchases.
- **Amenities / Happiness** → from luxuries & buildings; unhappiness penalizes growth & combat; revolt at extremes.
- **Maintenance:** units, buildings, and roads cost gold/turn — forces real economic trade-offs.

### 3.4 Cities
- Found with a **Settler**; city works tiles within a radius (grows from 1 → 3 rings).
- **Population** assigned to worked tiles or **specialist slots** (Scientist, Merchant, Artist, Priest, Engineer) in buildings.
- **Districts/quarters (lightweight):** city can dedicate quarters — Military (barracks/walls), Sacred (temples), Campus (library/university), Market, Harbor, Theater. Keeps the Civ-VI feel without heavy art.
- **Buildings:** Granary, Library, Market, Temple, Barracks, Walls, Aqueduct, Amphitheater, University, Bank, Cathedral, Harbor, Lighthouse, Workshop, Forge, Shipyard, Bazaar, Observatory, etc.
- **City defense:** walls give HP + ranged strike; cities can be besieged & captured (not always razed).
- **Loyalty/unrest:** distant or recently conquered cities can flip if loyalty drops — discourages infinite blob expansion.

> 📄 **Full tech tree (85 techs, prereqs, eurekas) + civics summary:** [TECHNOLOGIES.md](TECHNOLOGIES.md)

### 3.5 Technology & Civics (two parallel trees)
- **Tech tree** (Science): ~80–100 techs across 5 eras. Unlocks units, buildings, improvements, wonders. Examples: Pottery, Animal Husbandry, Bronze Working, Writing, Wheel, Iron Working, Masonry, Mathematics, Currency, Construction, Engineering, Optics (ocean travel), Machinery (crossbow), Castles, Banking, Astronomy, Printing Press, Gunpowder, Cartography, Sailing→Caravels→Galleons.
- **Civics tree** (Culture): governments & policies. Governments: **Chiefdom → Despotism / Republic → Oligarchy / Classical Republic → Monarchy / Theocracy → Merchant Republic**, each with policy-card slots (Military, Economic, Diplomatic, Wildcard). Policies are swappable, enabling build-your-own playstyle.
- **Wonders:** world wonders (one per game) + national wonders. Pyramids, Hanging Gardens, Great Library, Colossus, Oracle, Great Lighthouse, Terracotta Army, Petra, Hagia Sophia, Alhambra, Forbidden City, Notre Dame, University of Sankoré, Machu Picchu, Borobudur, Angkor Wat, etc.

### 3.6 Units & "Characters"
> 📄 **Full Great People rosters + Legends (heroes) roster:** [GREAT-PEOPLE.md](GREAT-PEOPLE.md)

The roster is intentionally rich. Units have: a **class**, **combat strength**, **movement**, **range**, **abilities**, **XP/promotions**, and can earn a **veteran name**.

**Civilian / Support characters**
- **Settler / Founder** — establishes cities.
- **Worker / Laborer** — builds improvements (charge-based).
- **Scout / Pathfinder / Explorer** — vision, ignores terrain cost, finds ruins/huts.
- **Trader / Caravan** — establishes trade routes (gold/science/food); vulnerable to raiders.
- **Missionary / Apostle / Inquisitor** — spread or defend religion; apostles can debate (religious combat).
- **Envoy / Diplomat** — influence city-states / minor powers.
- **Spy / Agent** — steal tech/gold, sabotage, counter-intelligence (Exploration era).
- **Military Engineer** — roads, forts, siege support, can repair.
- **Naval Explorer** — early ocean crossing.

**Great People** (finite, earned via specialist points — true named characters with one-shot or passive powers)
- **Great General** (Strategos / Khan / Legate) — combat aura + can build a Citadel.
- **Great Admiral** — naval aura, heal at sea, extra movement.
- **Great Scientist** (Scholar / Astronomer / Philosopher) — free tech / science burst / eureka.
- **Great Engineer** (Architect / Artisan) — wonder production, free building, fortifications.
- **Great Merchant** — gold/trade bonus, acquire luxuries, establish trade post.
- **Great Prophet** — *founds a religion*, defines its beliefs.
- **Great Writer / Artist / Musician** — Great Works (culture & tourism).
- **Great Statesman / Lawgiver** — bonus policy slot / instant civic.

**Hero units — "Legends" (a core feature)** — historical figures as powerful, limited unique characters that are central to the game's identity. Each Legend has:
- A **recruitment path** (earned via faith/culture/great-people points, wonders, or quests), so heroes are a strategic resource, not guaranteed.
- **Signature abilities** (e.g. Sun Tzu boosts nearby unit XP & grants a free promotion; Hannibal gets crossing/ambush bonuses; Joan of Arc rallies and heals; Genghis Khan supercharges cavalry; Mansa Musa pumps trade gold; Imhotep accelerates wonders).
- A **lifespan / cooldown** (heroes can expire or need recharging) to keep them precious and prevent snowballing.
- **Quests & rivalries** that tie into the world (free a city, win a battle, found a religion).
- Roster spanning all regions & eras: Hammurabi, Cyrus, Leonidas, Alexander, Hannibal, Boudica, Ashoka, Sun Tzu, Qin Shi Huang, Saladin, Genghis Khan, Tomoe Gozen, Joan of Arc, Mansa Musa, Pachacuti, Gilgamesh, Imhotep, and more.
- Still **toggleable off** per game for purists, but on by default and balanced as part of the core loop.

**Military — combined arms with class identity**
- *Melee infantry:* Warrior → Spearman → Swordsman → Man-at-Arms (+ civ uniques: Hoplite, Legionary, Immortal, Huscarl, Samurai, Jaguar Warrior).
- *Anti-cavalry:* Spearman → Pikeman (bonus vs mounted).
- *Ranged:* Slinger → Archer → Composite Bowman → Crossbowman → Longbowman.
- *Skirmishers:* Javelineer / Peltast (hit-and-run).
- *Light cavalry:* Horseman → Horse Archer → Hussar (+ Mangudai, Cossack).
- *Heavy cavalry:* Companion Cavalry → Cataphract → Knight → Lancer → Conquistador.
- *War beasts:* War Elephant, Camel Archer, War Dogs.
- *Chariots:* Light Chariot → Heavy / Scythed Chariot.
- *Siege:* Battering Ram → Catapult → Ballista → Trebuchet → Bombard (gunpowder).
- *Gunpowder (Exploration):* Arquebusier / Musketeer; early field Cannon.
- *Naval:* Galley → Bireme/Trireme → Quinquereme/Dromon → Longship → War Junk → Galleass → **Caravel → Galleon** (the late-game ocean enablers).
- *Support:* Medic, Standard Bearer, Supply Train, Siege Tower (attaches to melee).

**Promotion / veterancy system**
- Units earn **XP** from combat. At thresholds they pick **promotions** from trees:
  - *Melee:* Shock (vs open), Drill (vs rough), Charge, Formation, Cover.
  - *Ranged:* Accuracy, Barrage, Volley, Garrison.
  - *Cavalry:* Pursuit, Flanking, Caparison.
  - *Naval:* Boarding, Bombardment, Coastal Raider, Wolfpack.
  - *Universal:* Medic, March (heal while moving), Logistics (extra attack), Morale.
- Veteran units get a **generated name & rank** ("The IX Legion 'Hispana'"), creating attachment.

### 3.7 Combat
- **Combat strength** model with modifiers: terrain, fortification, flanking, support, river crossing, health, promotions, great-general aura, era diff.
- **Ranged units** strike without taking retaliation; **melee** trades damage.
- **Zone of control**, **flanking bonuses**, **city sieges** (walls absorb, must be ground down by siege).
- **Combat is HP-based** (units have hit points; not one-shot) → tactical depth, retreats, healing.

### 3.8 Religion
- A **Great Prophet** founds a religion → choose a Pantheon belief + Founder/Follower/Enhancer beliefs.
- Spread via **Missionaries/Apostles**, pressure from holy cities, and trade routes.
- **Theological combat** between apostles. Religious victory path = dominant religion worldwide.

### 3.9 Culture & Tourism
- Great Works fill slots in Amphitheaters/Museums/Wonders.
- **Tourism** accumulates against other civs' culture → **Culture victory** when you're "influential" over everyone.

### 3.10 Diplomacy & Trade
- **City-states / minor powers** (independent cities you befriend via envoys for bonuses).
- Player diplomacy: open borders, declarations of friendship, defensive pacts, denouncements, formal war/peace, trade deals (gold, resources, cities, tech in Exploration era).
- **Trade routes** (caravans/cargo ships) generate yields and spread religion/culture; can be **plundered**.
- **Casus belli** system: warmongering penalties reduced if you have justification (liberation, holy war, reconquest).

### 3.11 Victory Conditions
1. **Domination** — control every original capital.
2. **Science** — reach the pinnacle pre-modern achievement (e.g. complete the great voyages / circumnavigation + a capstone wonder). *(Adapted since there's no space race in this era.)*
3. **Culture** — be tourism-dominant over all rivals.
4. **Religious** — your religion is dominant in every civ.
5. **Economic / Trade** — control a target share of world trade & treasury (fits the Age of Exploration finale).
6. **Score** — highest score at turn limit.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Monorepo layout
```
rise-of-civilizations/
  packages/
    shared/      # TS types, game rules constants, hex math, RNG, serialization (used by client AND server)
    sim/         # deterministic game simulation: state, command processing, resolution
    client/      # canvas renderer, input, UI, netcode client (browser)
    server/      # Bun: websocket gateway, matchmaking, game host loop, persistence
    data/        # JSON/TS data: civs, units, techs, buildings, terrain, beliefs (data-driven)
    ai/          # single-player / fill AI (runs server-side or in a worker)
  docs/
    PLAN.md
  tools/         # map preview, balance spreadsheets, data validators
```
- **Bun workspaces** (or pnpm) for the monorepo. `shared` + `sim` are pure TS with **no DOM and no Node/Bun APIs** so they run identically in browser, Bun, and a Web Worker.

### 4.2 Client — rendering & input
- **Canvas 2D** to start (broadest device support, simplest). Architect the renderer behind an interface so a **WebGL/WebGPU** batched backend can replace it later if perf demands.
- **Render approach for "tiny download":** graphics are **procedural/vector** — hexes, units, and improvements are drawn from code (paths, polygons, gradients) and/or a **single small generated sprite atlas baked at build time or first load**. No multi-megabyte art packs up front. Icons can be a compact SVG/font set.
- **Camera:** pan/zoom with culling (only draw visible hexes). Dirty-rectangle / layered canvases (terrain layer cached to an offscreen canvas, units/UI on top) to keep mobile framerates up.
- **Game loop:** `requestAnimationFrame` for render; simulation is event/turn-driven, not per-frame.
- **Input abstraction:** unified pointer events → works for mouse, touch, pen. Mobile UX: tap-to-select, tap-to-move, long-press context, pinch-zoom, edge-pan, large touch targets, bottom-sheet panels. Responsive layout (portrait & landscape).
- **State:** an **ECS-lite** or normalized store for entities; the renderer reads from the authoritative client mirror of game state.
- **PWA:** installable, offline shell, service-worker caching so repeat loads are instant.

### 4.3 Graphics / asset budget (the "no big download" requirement)
- **Initial bundle target: < ~1.5 MB gzipped** (code + minimal atlas + fonts).
- Code-split by route/phase: **menu/lobby chunk** loads first; the **heavy sim + in-game renderer** chunk loads when a match starts (with a progress bar). The map/data for a specific match streams from the server.
- Game data (civs/units/techs) is JSON, fetched per-match and cached.
- Optional higher-fidelity art packs are **lazy, opt-in downloads** post-MVP — never required to play.

### 4.4 Networking model — *server-authoritative state sync*
- **Transport:** WebSocket (Bun's native WS). Binary frames (e.g. MessagePack or a compact custom schema) for state/orders.
- **Authority:** the **server owns the simulation**. Clients send **orders/commands** ("move unit 42 to (q,r)", "set city production", "research X"). Server validates against the authoritative `sim` state and rejects illegal orders → cheat-resistant.
- **Why not lockstep/deterministic P2P:** turn-based + server-authoritative is simpler, robust to disconnects, and naturally supports async play. We still keep `sim` **deterministic** (seeded RNG, integer math where possible) so the server can run it and clients can *predict* locally for snappy UI.
- **Sync:** server sends **state deltas** per resolved turn (and incremental order acks during a turn). Reconnect → server sends a full snapshot. Fog of war is enforced server-side: a client only receives what its civ can see (also prevents map-hacking).
- **Prediction:** client optimistically applies its own legal orders for responsiveness, reconciles on server confirmation.

### 4.5 Server — Bun
- **Bun HTTP + WebSocket** server. Responsibilities:
  - **Auth** (sign-up/login, JWT/session; optional OAuth later).
  - **Lobby & matchmaking** (create/join game, ready-up, settings: map size, # players, civs, era pace, async on/off).
  - **Game host loop:** one logical "game host" per active match holds the in-memory authoritative `sim` state, processes incoming orders, resolves turns, persists snapshots.
  - **Persistence:** write state to Postgres each turn (and on demand) so games survive restarts and power async play.
  - **AI driver:** for empty slots / single-player, runs the `ai` package server-side.
  - **Notifications:** "it's your turn" via WebSocket if online, push/web-push/email if not (async games).
- **Scaling:** each match is independent → horizontally scalable. Start single-process; later shard matches across worker processes/instances with a router keyed by `gameId`. Heavy turn resolution can run in a **worker thread** to avoid blocking the gateway.

### 4.6 Database — PostgreSQL
Core tables (sketch):
```
users(id, handle, email, pass_hash, created_at, ...)
games(id, name, status, settings_json, map_seed, current_turn, is_async, turn_deadline, created_at)
game_players(game_id, user_id, slot, civ_id, is_ai, is_alive, score, last_seen, has_submitted_turn)
game_snapshots(game_id, turn, state_blob, created_at)         -- compact binary/jsonb authoritative state
game_orders(game_id, turn, player_slot, order_blob, received_at)  -- audit log / replay / dispute resolution
chat_messages(game_id, user_id, body, created_at)
sessions(token, user_id, expires_at)
```
- **Authoritative state** stored as a compact blob (`bytea`/`jsonb`) per snapshot; we don't need full relational modeling of every unit for the live sim (it lives in memory), but we **keep an order log** for replays, debugging, and dispute resolution.
- Indices on `(game_id, turn)`, player lookups, and "games awaiting my turn."
- Migrations via a lightweight tool (e.g. `drizzle`/`kysely`/raw SQL files). Use a typed query builder for safety.

### 4.7 Shared determinism & anti-cheat
- All randomness flows through a **seeded PRNG** in `shared`. Same seed + same orders ⇒ same outcome.
- Server is the only authority that advances `sim`; clients can run the identical `sim` for prediction but never dictate results.
- Fog-of-war filtering happens server-side per recipient.

## 5. Roadmap / Milestones

The strategy is **vertical slice first**, then widen. Each milestone is playable.

**M0 — Foundations (skeleton)** ✅ *done*
- ✅ Monorepo (Bun workspaces) with `shared`/`sim`/`client`/`server`/`data`/`ai`, TS strict, Vite, vitest.
- ✅ `shared`: hex math (axial + odd-r offset, pixel conversions), seeded RNG, map types — unit-tested.
- ✅ `sim`: procedural world generation (fractal value-noise → terrain + coasts).
- ✅ `client`: canvas renders a pannable/zoomable hex grid on desktop + mobile (drag pan, wheel/pinch zoom, hover readout). Build ~4 KB gzipped.
- ⏳ Remaining for later: lint/format config + CI.

**M1 — Single-player vertical slice (no server yet)** ✅ *done*
- ✅ Map generation from a seed, in `sim`.
- ✅ Found a city with a Settler; auto-worked tiles; yields (food/prod/gold/science), growth.
- ✅ Units move on the grid with movement points (Dijkstra reachable) & per-player fog of war.
- ✅ 6-tech tree with prereq gating; city production of units & buildings (Granary/Library).
- ✅ Hotseat 2-player turn flow (authoritative `sim` with validated commands — the M3 server model).
- Verified end-to-end through the real UI (found city, move, research, end-turn fog switch).

**M2 — Combat & depth** ✅ *done*
- ✅ HP-based combat (deterministic damage), melee vs ranged, terrain defense, wounded penalty, advance-after-kill.
- ✅ 10 unit types across classes (settler/worker/scout/warrior/slinger/archer/spearman/swordsman/horseman/catapult), anti-cavalry & anti-city bonuses.
- ✅ XP + leveling + a promotion system (shock/drill/cover/accuracy/barrage/siege/medic).
- ✅ City HP/defense, siege, and **capture** (melee takes a 0-HP city); walls/barracks buildings.
- ✅ Barbarians (a non-human player) with simple aggressive AI, auto-run between human turns.
- ✅ Workers build improvements (farm/mine) + roads (cheaper movement); expanded 12-tech tree.
- ⏳ Deferred to a later step: world/national **wonders** (the roadmap's "first wonders").

**M3 — Multiplayer server (real-time simultaneous first)** ✅ *playable in-browser; persistence/timer pending*
- ✅ Bun HTTP+WS gateway, auth (register/login/resume via `Bun.password`), in-memory lobby (create/join/start).
- ✅ **Server-authoritative** sim: orders validated per-owner (`applyCommand(state, cmd, actingPlayerId)`); illegal orders rejected.
- ✅ **Real-time simultaneous turns** (`startSimultaneousTurn`/`resolveSimultaneousTurn`): all players act, resolve when all ready (barbarians + economy tick, turn advances).
- ✅ **Server-side fog filtering** (`viewForPlayer`) — clients only receive explored tiles + visible entities (anti-maphack).
- ✅ Verified end-to-end: vitest core tests + a live **WebSocket smoke test** (2 clients register→create→join→start→found→ready→resolve).
- ✅ **M3b — browser multiplayer**: lobby UI (single-player + connect/register/login/create/join/start), a `Session` abstraction (`LocalSession` keeps single-player; `OnlineSession` renders server views + sends orders), verified live in-browser (register → create → start → render fog-filtered map → found-city order round-trips through the server).
- ⏳ Postgres persistence (Storage interface + in-memory done; Postgres adapter via `Bun.sql` pending a DB); turn timer + combat-lock sub-phase; async play-by-cloud + notifications.

**M4 — Systems width** 🚧 *in progress*
- ✅ **Victory conditions** (domination — last-standing or all original capitals; score at the turn limit) with detection + in-game game-over banner; `gameOver` flows through the server view.
- ✅ **Original tech tree** (not a Civ clone): ~33 techs organised around real materials/techniques (Stone Knapping, Fire-Hardening, Smelting, Bronze Alloying, Carburizing, Torsion Engines, Equestrianism…). See `packages/sim/src/game/content.ts` (supersedes the earlier Civ-style draft in TECHNOLOGIES.md).
- ✅ **Deep unit roster** (~29 land units across roles & eras: clubman/warrior/slinger/javelineer/hunter → fire-hardened spear/war-dogs/archer → axeman/maceman/spearman/hoplite/chariots/riders/horse-archer → swordsman/longsword/pikeman/cataphract/crossbow/legionary/war-elephant + siege ram/catapult/ballista). Some available immediately, others tech-gated. AI is class-based so it adapts.
- ✅ **Reworked buildings** (Granary/Workshop/Forge/Walls/Barracks/Stable/Market/Archive/Academy/Aqueduct/Harbor/Monument), tech-gated.
- ✅ **Territory / cultural borders**: cities claim their tile + ring on founding and expand outward as population grows; only owned tiles can be worked; borders rendered (tinted region + outline), shown in the city panel, and sent through the fog-filtered server view.
- ✅ **Map features** — **tribal Villages** (random perk on entry: learn a tech, gold, production/citizen boost, free unit, free promotion, or a barbarian ambush) and **Barbarian Camps** (periodically spawn raiders; clear them with a military unit for a reward). Deterministic (seeded) so the server & clients agree. Rendered as ? / ! markers; flow through the server view. Barbarians now **raze** captured cities rather than holding them.
- ✅ **Game-creation menu** — single-player setup (map size S/M/L, 0–4 AI opponents, barbarians toggle) and the same map-size + AI-fill options on multiplayer create. Engine generalised to **N players** with greedy-spread starts and an 8-colour palette.
- ✅ **In-game UI polish** — clickable **minimap** (explored terrain + cities/units + viewport rect, click-to-recenter), a **research progress bar**, **combat-odds preview** on hover ("vs Archer: deal 45 · take 20"), and a **Victory/Defeat overlay** with winner/condition + Back to Menu.
- ⏳ Civics trees & governments/policies; **civ data layer** (distinct civ abilities).
- ⏳ Religion, culture/tourism, trade routes, diplomacy & city-states.
- ⏳ 10 launch civilizations (data-driven), each with UU/UI/ability.
- ⏳ **First Legends (heroes)** wired into recruitment + abilities (core feature).
- ⏳ **Real-world geodata map pipeline** integrated into `tools/` + first curated Earth/Mediterranean presets.

**M5 — Content, AI, polish** 🚧 *AI started*
- ✅ Basic single-player **AI** opponent (rules/utility controller — expands, researches, builds, defends & attacks). Runs **on-device** (pure TS in the browser/server), no API. Behind an `AiController` interface so an on-device learned model (ONNX/TF.js in a worker) can drop in later. Single Player = 1 human vs 1 AI (+ barbarians).
- Expand civ roster toward 60+, more wonders/units, Great People, and the full Legends roster.
- More curated geodata maps (Americas, Europe, East Asia) + start-bias overlays.
- Balance pass, tutorials/onboarding, PWA install, performance tuning for low-end mobile.
- Packaging exploration (Capacitor/Tauri for app stores) — *after* web is solid.

## 6. Key Technical Decisions (recommended defaults)

| Decision | Recommendation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Grid | **Hex** | Cleaner movement/ranged/adjacency than squares |
| Rendering | **Canvas 2D first**, renderer behind an interface | Max device support, simplest; swap to WebGL later if needed |
| Art | **Procedural/vector + tiny baked atlas** | Meets "no big download"; matches "simple graphics" |
| Turn model | **Real-time simultaneous first**, async on same engine | Chosen: live sessions first; async reuses the code |
| Netcode | **Server-authoritative state sync** (not P2P lockstep) | Robust, cheat-resistant, async-friendly |
| Maps | **Procedural + real-world geodata (d3/Natural Earth), both from start** | Chosen: baked at build time, runtime stays tiny |
| Heroes | **Legends are a core feature** (toggleable off) | Chosen: central to identity, balanced into the loop |
| Tone | **Historically grounded** | Chosen: real leaders/agendas, educational flavor |
| Language across stack | **TypeScript everywhere**, pure `shared`/`sim` | One codebase of rules for client, server, AI |
| Server | **Bun + native WebSocket** | As requested; fast, modern, great DX |
| DB | **Postgres** (snapshots + order log) | As requested; durable, supports async/replay |
| Packaging | **PWA now, Capacitor/Tauri later** | Web-first requirement; app stores deferred |

## 7. Risks & Open Questions

- **Simultaneous-turn combat resolution** is the trickiest fairness problem → needs a clearly specified, deterministic resolution order and tie-breaks (design doc before coding M3).
- **AI quality** for a deep 4X is a large effort → start rules/utility-based and iterate; it's the longest pole for satisfying single-player.
- **Balance across 60+ civs** is ongoing → keep everything data-driven so balance is tuning, not refactoring.
- **Mobile performance** with large maps → aggressive culling, layered/cached canvases, and a possible WebGL backend are the mitigation.
- **Scope** is very large → the milestone plan keeps a *playable* build at every step so we never have an unshippable mass of half-features.
- **Real-time simultaneous netcode** (chosen launch mode) raises the bar on latency, reconnect handling, and the combat-lock fairness sub-phase → prototype the resolution rules early (a design doc + a tiny simulation harness before full M3).

### Resolved direction (locked in from kickoff):
1. **Tone:** ✅ Historically grounded — real leaders/agendas, educational flavor text.
2. **Legends (heroes):** ✅ Core feature, on by default, with recruitment + abilities + lifespan; toggleable off for purists.
3. **Primary multiplayer mode:** ✅ Real-time simultaneous first; async play-by-cloud follows on the same engine.
4. **Maps:** ✅ Both procedural and curated from the start, including **real-world geodata maps** (d3-geo + Natural Earth/TopoJSON) baked to our hex format at build time — World, continent, and region presets. See §3.1.1.
